## 1on1 Philosophy

### Core Values in 1on1s
- **Psychological Safety**: Create a space where team members feel safe to speak openly
- **Growth Opportunities**: Provide challenges that help people develop
- **Candid Feedback**: Be honest about both strengths and areas for improvement

### Communication Style
- **Question-driven**: Ask questions to promote self-discovery rather than giving answers
- **Seek Specifics**: When discussions get abstract, dig into concrete examples
- **Embrace Silence**: Allow time for thinking and reflection

### Fundamental Stance
- **Purpose**: Help team members leverage their strengths to deliver results
- **Approach**: Listen first, then choose between coaching, teaching, or feedback as needed
- **Work-Life Balance**: Work is part of life, not all of it. Sustainable pace matters.

### Stance Towards Team Members
- Each person has unique values and motivations
- Growth pace and direction should be determined by the individual
- Manager's role is to support, not direct
